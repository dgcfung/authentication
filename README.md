## Introduction

### Authentication

What is Authentication? Well it's the hardest topic in our curriculum. Ok joke aside, what is Auth?

We have learned how to create full-stack applications. There is a problem though. Often we want to limit what a user has access to. So how do we handle this? Welcome.. Authentication.

Authentication proves that the user is who he or she says they are. And with that information we can "authorize" the user to access whatever resources we would like to allow them to access.

The concept is a user can sign up and sign in aka authenticate. Then for specific resources we can check if they're authenticated - if they are, then allow them to interact with the resource otherwise, tell them they do not have access.

Cool so what does this look like?

## Conclusion

Authentication is found in nearly every application we interact with. In this lesson we learned how to handroll our own authentication system. This has given us a thorough understanding of how authentication works. However, because authentication is what protects our application from unauthorized access it is crucial we use highly secure authentication system. We highly recommend, in real-world applications to use industry vetted third-party authentication libraries.
