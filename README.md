# Authentication

![](user-friendly.png)

What is Authentication? Well it's the hardest topic in our curriculum. Ok joke aside, what is Auth?

We have learned how to creat full-stack applications. There is a problem though. Often we do not want to let the enduser access everything on our website or we only want a certain set of users to be able to access a specific resource. So how do we handle this? Welcome, Authentication.

The concept is a user can sign up and sign in aka authenticate. Then for specific resources we can check if they're authenticated - if they are allow them to interact with the resource otherwise, tell them they do not have access.

Cool so what does this look like?
